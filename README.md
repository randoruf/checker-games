# Checker Game Project Proposal

Randolph

 

### Objectives 

* Create a 3D checker game in webpage, [source 1](http://www.osd.net/blog/web-development/3d-board-game-in-a-browser-using-webgl-and-three-js-part-2/) , [source 2](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.3602/courses/cse3541-2014-spring/proj_proposal/Jordan_Bertke/index.html)
* AI strategies including random, probabilistic player*, Min-Max, heuristic player(simple and additional information to enhance its decision at each turn, simulated annealing, genetic algorithm), Monte-Carlo tree search, machine learning algorithms (CS229), neural network (not deep learning). 

*probabilistic : being able to make use of probabilities to determine which checkers have the highest chance of winning the game. 

### Implementation

IDK
